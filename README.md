# Breakout-game-javafx
A school project where I make simple breakout game in javafx.
The variables and comments are mostly in finnish due to it being a school project.
This project is one of my first ones, it does not most likely repesent my current skill level.
Documentation can be found inside Breakout/liitteet.
